# Design Process

## Insperation
Inspired by concept of digital nomadry I decided to play on the themes of adventure, trekking, and exploration, and link it back to the concept of mobile working.

When looking for imagery, I sought out depictions of broad spanning landscape, adventurers and hiking gear. I found myself most drawn to obcsured shots of individuals hiking and dusk and evening shots with a cold filter.

## Logo Decisions

My logo's aesthetic was drawn from blending the core theme and isometric design.

I chose this style because I believed it could easily be integrated my site using svg assets created in Adobe Illustrator.

Attempting to encapsulate the feeling of adventure and new horizons, my design depict a rising sun behind two mountains. The silhouette of the mountains also creates soft "M", which when inversed, is also my initils.


## Colour Scheme

I aimed to keep to a cooler colour scheme using a deep blue as my primary background to convey the sense of calm one feels when hiking at dusk. This also presented a valuable contrast against my coral red highlights, which were used to draw focus to individual elements and make the page more dynamic.

## Visibility

Working against my primary background I chose to use a bone white (FFF7EA) for all my type. This gave me ample contrast, earning a AAA rating in colour selector. I used an off-white palette to not only enhance readability but also to adhere to a grounded.

# Development Process


After story boarding and comparing colours in figma, I sketched up some ideas for potential layouts.

I chose a single page design because I wanted the header and foot images to bleed into each page, and create a seamless transition form section to section.

Working in Adobe Illustrator I create a series of svgs to support my site and aligned them to the concept of each page.

As I had planned to work with CSS Grid, I roughed up the approximate grid lines on each section.

## Challanges

Working with multiple layers of nested grids, while on one page, I found that alignment often reacted in unexpected ways. This was a particularly large challenge when working with a svg dominant design.


While time constraints limit my ability to format the css entirely as planned, I am happy with the overall result and look forward to further developing and streamlining the design and code.

## Success

Despite the difficulty present in layout, the overall design and functionality present the infortmation on myself and my skills in a easily readable manner.


## Future Improvements
 
In future iterations I will aim to:

• redesigning the css grid to reduce dependance on nested grids.

• correcting alignments and expanding on stylised formating.

• introducing an overlay nav.


• introduce a horizontal slider for the project preview and skills slider.


• include media queries for web
